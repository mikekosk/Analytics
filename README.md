Included is a collection of some analytics and machine learning work I've done recently

If you want to follow along "lesson style" here's my suggested progression:

- Loss Functions and Gradient Descent
- Buliding our own K-Means Algorithm
- K-Nearest Neighbors and Hyperparameter Search
- Model Validation Techniques
- Hyperparameter Selection and Visualization
- Feature Selection
- Ensemble Methods
- Numerai Competition Attempt
